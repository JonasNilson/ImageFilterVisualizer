# ImageFilterVisualizer
An interactive MATLAB application that allows users to select a filter, specify the filter order and the cutoff frequency. The filter frequency response is automatically plotted and the image filtering result can be viewed graphically, both in the spatial domain and the frequency domain.

The application has been developed using the MATLAB App Designer, and includes functions from the image processing toolbox and the signal processing toolbox.
